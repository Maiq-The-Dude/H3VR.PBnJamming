# PB 'n' Jamming 

A WIP firearm malfunction mod inspired by [Meatyceiver 2](https://github.com/potatoes1286/H3VR.Meatyceiver2). This mod builds onto Meatyceiver's core idea and adds modular firearm tags used to determine failure rates at a granular level.

## Features
- A firearm's failure rate is determined by the combination of the following firearm tags:
  - ItemID
  - Era
  - Action
  - Round Type
  - Magazine
- Firearm tags are modular and easy to config and add to. Uses [Deli](https://github.com/Deli-Counter/Deli) to easily load corresponding JSON files.

## Installation
No releases available yet. To install you must build the project yourself and place into `mods` folder as this is a Deli mod.

## Uninstallation
